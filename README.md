# 🏠 Old Age Home Resident Management System

A database-driven system developed using **MySQL** to efficiently manage resident information, medical records, and payment details in an Old Age Home.

This project replaces manual record-keeping with a structured relational database system to ensure accuracy, consistency, and data security.


## 📌 Project Overview

The **Old Age Home Resident Management System** is designed to:

* Store resident personal details
* Maintain medical records
* Track payment information
* Generate meaningful reports using SQL queries
* Ensure data integrity using constraints

The system is fully implemented using **MySQL Server** and SQL queries.


## 🎯 Objectives

* Design a structured relational database
* Reduce data redundancy
* Maintain referential integrity using Primary & Foreign Keys
* Implement SQL queries (Basic & Advanced)
* Generate reports using JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING
* Ensure secure data handling


## 🔐 Constraints Used

* **PRIMARY KEY** – Unique identification
* **FOREIGN KEY** – Maintains relationships
* **NOT NULL** – Mandatory fields
* **UNIQUE** – Prevents duplication
